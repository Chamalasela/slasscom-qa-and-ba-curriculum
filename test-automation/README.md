## Introduction

In software testing, test automation is the use of software separate from the software being tested to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes 
with predicted outcomes. Test automation can automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or perform additional testing that would be difficult to do manually.
